I Yinka. Once again compliments of the season.

You could totally scrap what I have in mind and go with what you think. But you would would need to produce a better 
version of the current one all in their 3 different sizes. Would need it by Wednesday latest. So no rush. Lol!

# Product description
The Audio Manager is a library plugin that provides a simple way to manage and control your 2D gameâ€™s background music 
and sound effects.

# What I have in mind
For now all I know is that I would want
A controller icon of some sort in it (Not a game controller)
A Music icon and maybe a sound effects icon to represent sound
Or they could be in form of a wave


# Reason
The reason why you are redesigning the images are stated below:

It was said that my previous key images are not to the quality that is an acceptable standard for the Asset Store. 
Quite often this takes the form of an image being too busy, clashing colors, using the Unity camera default blue 
or default skybox, plain text, or not being a good representation of your content.
Please redesign your images to be more aesthetically pleasing and attractive. 
Having high-quality key images improves your packages marketing presence and is quite a substantial portion 
of being successful on the Asset Store


# Guidelines
There are a few guidelines you would need to adhere to. I've attached a .pdf document of the guidelines
